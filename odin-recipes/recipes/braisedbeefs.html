    <h1>Braised Beef</h1>

    <h3>Recipe Description</h3>

    <p>
        An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness.<br>
        It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.
    </p>

    <p>
        Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. <br>
        In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine.<br>
         Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.

    <p>
        Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder <br>

    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. <br>
        Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. <br>
        Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. <br>
        Remove meat from the pan and set aside.  <br>

    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes, stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom. <br>
        Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.  <br>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. <br>
        Return the meat to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and Worcestershire.<br>

    </p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Pour in beef broth just enough that it comes up 2/3 of the way up on the beef (do not fully submerge the meat in liquid).<br>
        Bring the mixture to a simmer. <br>
