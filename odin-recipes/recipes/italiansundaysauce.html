    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Sprinkle neck bones on all sides with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Heat 4 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.<br>
        Place neck bones in the pot and cook for 6 minutes, flipping halfway through.<br>
        Transfer to a plate.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Add sausage links to the drippings and brown for 3 minutes on each side, adding remaining oil as needed.<br>
        Set aside with the pork.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Add onion to the drippings and season with salt. <br>
        Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.<br> 
        Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.<br> 
        Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>

        Add tomato puree and crushed tomatoes, than add water and sugar; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth.<br> 
        Add bay leaf.<br>
        Rub basil and oregano between your fingers to release the aroma and add to the sauce.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Slice sausages into large chunks and return to the pot with the neck bones; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.<br> 
        Add meatballs, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 6 hours.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
        Remove neck bones and bay leaf.<br>
        Remove any meat remaining on the bones, shred, and return to the sauce.
